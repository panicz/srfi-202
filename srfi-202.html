<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The SRFI-2 library introduced the <code>and-let*</code> form
  for short-circuited evaluation in the style of the <code>and</code>
  form with the ability to capture the (non-<code>#f</code>) results
  in the style of the <code>let*</code> form. This document extends
  the <code>and-let*</code> form with the abilities to pattern-match
  (or "destructurally bind") the values of evaluated expressions
  (where the match failure causes short-circuiting rather than
  raising an error), and to handle multiple values (where only the
  falsehood of the first value causes short-circuiting).
</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

None at present.

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>It is well known that, in the context of the <code>if</code> condition,
  Scheme treats <code>#f</code> as a <i>false</i> value, and every other value
  is considered true (or "true-ish").</p>

<p>This design decision has led to the development of the idiom in which the
  <code>#f</code> is considered to represent "the absence of value" or a "failure
  of computation", whereas and other value is considered to represent a meaningful
  result.</p>

<p>In strongly typed languages, this pattern is usually expressed in terms of algebraic
  data types. For example, the Haskell language defines the polymorphic type
  <code>Maybe a</code> as either <code>Just a</code> or <code>Nothing</code>,
  where <code>Just a</code> is used to represent the value of type <code>a</code>,
  and <code>Nothing</code> is used to represent the absence of value.</p>

<p>Moreover, in many functional languages, the types isomorphic to <code>Maybe</code>
  are considered to be "monads", which means that they can use some facilities
  that those languages provide for sequencing functions that return things that
  are considered to be "monads". In particular, Haskell provides a special syntactic
  form called the <code>do</code> notation, which allows the function like</p>

<pre>
  h x = case (f x) of
          Just y -> case (g (k y)) of
                      Just z -> Just (l z)
                      Nothing -> Nothing
          Nothing -> Nothing
</pre>

to be rewritten as

<pre>
  h x = do
    y &lt;- (f x)
    z &lt;- (g (k y))
    return (l z)
</pre>

<p>where <code>f</code> and <code>g</code> (and <code>h</code>) return
  optional values, and <code>k</code> and <code>l</code> return obligatory
  values.</p>

<p>Since these facilities rely on some advanced features of type systems
  that are lacking from most Scheme implementations, Schemers have invented
  a special form specifically for dealing with optional values. The form
  is called <code>and-let*</code> and has been defined in the SRFI-2 document.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the equivalent code using Scheme can be written as</p>

<pre>
  (define (h x)
    (and-let* ((y (f x))
               (z (g (k y))))
      (l z)))
</pre>

<p>However, the original definition of <code>and-let*</code> does not allow
  one to handle multiple values. It also doesn't allow one to destructure the value
  of the evaluated expression. The purpose of this SRFI is to extend the
  <code>and-let*</code> form with these capabilities.</p>

<p>Therefore, with the capabilities from this SRFI, the two first examples
  from the Rationale section of SRFI 2, namely:</p>

<pre>
  (and-let* ((my-list (compute-list))
             ((not (null? my-list))))
    (do-something my-list))

  (define (lookup key alist)
    (and-let* ((x (assq key alist)))
      (cdr x)))
</pre>

<p>could roughly be rewritten as:</p>

<pre>
  (and-let* ((`(,my . ,list) (compute-list)))
    (do-something `(,my . ,list)))

  (define (lookup key alist)
    (and-let* ((`(,key . ,value) (assq key alist)))
      key))
</pre>

<p>(The first example is not exactly equivalent, because it assumes
  that the test <code>(not (null? my-list))</code> has the same meaning
  as <code>(pair? my-list)</code>, which doesn't need to be true, even
  if usually is. Moreover, the body of the form contains an unnecessary
  <code>cons</code> operation which may incur performance penalty.)</p>

<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>The extensions provided here do not invalidate or modify any of the prior
  uses of the SRFI 2's <code>and-let*</code> form.</p>

<p>In particular, the <code>and-let*</code> form allowed two types of expressions
  inside of its "claws":</p>

<pre>(variable expression)</pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre>(guard-expression)</pre>

<p>This SRFI document allows <code>variable</code> to be an arbitrary
  pattern that is a valid pattern of the underlying pattern matcher
  (see <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-200">SRFI 200</a>
  Pattern Matching for more details):</p>

<pre>(pattern expression)</pre>

<p>In particular, since patterns can be literal values, it is possible
  to negate the condition:</p>

<pre>
  (and-let*  ((my-list (compute-list))
              (#f (null? my-list)))
    (do-something my-list))
</pre>

<p>If the value of an expression does not match the pattern, then the
  value of the whole <code>and-let*</code> form is <code>#f</code>.<p>

<p>This variant of the <code>and-let*</code> form also supports multiple
  values, each of which can be a pattern:</p>

<pre>(pattern patterns ... expression)</pre>

<p>If the first <code>pattern</code> is a variable, then it must have
  a non-<code>#f</code> value in order to proceed with evaluation
  &mdash; otherwise, the value of the whole <code>and-let*</code> form
  becomes <code>#f</code>.</p>

<p>If the <code>expression</code> returns fewer values than expected,
  then the value of the whole <code>and-let*</code> expression becomes
  <code>#f</code>. If it returns more values than expected, then the
  additional values are ignored.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<pre>
(define-syntax and-let*
  (lambda (stx)
    (syntax-case stx ()

      ((_)
       #'#t)

      ((_ ())
       #'#t)

      ((_ () body ...)
       #'(let () body ...))

      ((_ ((value expression) rest ...) body ...)
       (identifier? #'value)
       #'(let ((value expression))
	   (and value
		(and-let* (rest ...)
		   body ...))))

      ((_ ((value expression) rest ...) body ...)
       #'(match expression
	   (value
	    (and-let* (rest ...)
	      body ...))
	   (_ #f)))

      ((_ ((condition) rest ...)
	  body ...)
       #'(and condition
	      (and-let* (rest ...)
		body ...)))

      ((_ ((value values ... expression) rest ...) body ...)
       (identifier? #'value)
       #'(call-with-values (lambda () expression)
	   (lambda args
             (match args
              ((value values ... . _)
	       (and value
		    (and-let* (rest ...)
	               body ...)))
	      (_ #f)))))

      ((_ ((values ... expression) rest ...) body ...)
       #'(call-with-values (lambda () expression)
          (lambda args
            (match args
	      ((values ... . _)
	       (and-let* (rest ...)
	          body ...))
	      (_ #f)))))
      )))
